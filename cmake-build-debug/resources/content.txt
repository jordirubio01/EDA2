The restaurant is pleasant. Very good customer service. The waiter and waitress who attended us were very friendly, and they helped us choose typical dishes from Spain. Btw, don't stress about the price! We were a group of five at dinner. Highly recommended!

We went to visit the new sculpture, I don't remember its name. What I do remember is how well the security guy took care of us when my father felt dizzy. Nonetheless, they should have defibrillators at the entrance, that's why I'm not giving them 5 stars.
